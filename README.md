# Node Upload
Decided to start from scratch using a different dependency for uploading. Basics are working but this is **NOT** ready for use in a production environment.

**All screenshots use the tokens from the first GIF under the installing section. The screenshts may not be up to date so don't worry if the output in console looks slightly differnt.**
Most if not all commits are checked using JShint and ESLint on the command line and ESLint in Atom. Files checked this way:
- app.js
- createUser.js

## Installing
This project is not quite ready for public use yet, however, if you can use it if you want to.

```sh
npm install
node createUser.js # This is the script for creating users
nano config.json # If you want to change the default settings (you can use something other than nano for this)
node app.js
```

## Creating a New User
After you are done installing and your friend also wants to use this, run the following command and answer the questions.

```sh
node createUser.js
```

## Usage

If the server is not already started, run `node app.js`.
Once the server has started, open a web browser to `YOUR_IP:PORT` (where `PORT` is the port specified in the config file (`config.json`)).

If everything worked, it should show an upload form. Just add your token where it says `Token`, choose a file to upload, then click the button. It should upload. If not, check the console for errors. You may need to open an issue here.

Some file extensions are blacklisted by default. These are...
- .exe
- .html
- .bat
- .cmd
- .sh

### Admin Tools

There are also some admin tools (currently, deleting files and temporary files). These require an admin token which you get from answering `true` to the `Admin` question when running `createUser.js`.

You will need to use a program that can send headers with a GET request. I prefer using [Postman](https://getpostman.com).

 **Delete files in 'files' directory:**
  - Make a GET request to `YOUR_IP:PORT/admin/deletefiles` including a header with your admin token with the name `admintoken`.

  **Delete files in temporary directory (`OPERATING_SYSTEM_TMP/nodeupload_tmp/`)**
  - Make a GET request to `YOUR_IP:PORT/admin/deletetmp` including a header with your admin token with the name `admintoken`.

## FAQs

  > What is this?

  NodeUpload is a Node.js server application that lets you run your own private file upload service. It uses randomly generated tokens for upload authentication and includes some admin features that require an admin token (which are generated when running  `createUser.js` and answering `true` to the `Admin` question).

  > How are uploads done?

  When a user uploads a file, it will be stored in a directory in your operating system's tmp directory. Then there will be a connection to the database to check that the token is valid. If it is valid, the file gets moved to the `files` directory in the app's directory.

  > How are tokens generated?

  Tokens generated are **not** based on any information given when running `createUser.js`. The information there is only used to be stored in the database. The token is generated by the [`uuid` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) (`uuid/v4`) to generate a comletely random token.

  > What is the difference between a token and an admin token?

  A token (or upload token) is used for uploading files where an admin token is used for things like deleting files. An admin token cannot be used to upload and an upload token cannot be used for admin actions.

  > Why can a user with an admin token still do admin actions after their token has been disabled.

  Currently there is not a check for enabled accounts when doing admin actions. Uploads for disabled accounts will still be blocked however admin actions won't.

  > Why is there no check for information already existing in the database in the  `createUser.js` file?

  This has not been added yet however it is a minor issue as long as you ensure that no duplicate information goes into `createUser.js`.

  > Is there any way to change the port that it runs on?

  To change the port that NodeUpload runs on, edit the config file (`config.json`).

  > Is there any way to change the length of the generated file names of uploads?

  To change the length of the auto generated file names of uploads, edit the config file (`config.json`).

  > Is there any way to change the responses (console output, web responses, etc)?

  Yes, there is. Edit the `strings.json` file. More info coming soon.

  > Can I contribute to the development of NodeUpload?

  Yes, anyone can contribute to the development of NodeUpload. You can open a pull request to add in code or contact me using the contact form on [my website](https://www.ndt3.ml).

  > I found a bug, how do I report it?

  To report a bug, open an issue. Remember to include information like `It happened after I...` as this will help to find the issue.

  > Console full of errors... How do I get this working?

  Go to the [`Errors and Solutions`](#errors-and-solutions) section below

## Errors and Solutions
You may come across some of these while using this.

- `EACCES` (Permission denied): Make sure that you have permissions to access files in that directory.

- `EADDRINUSE` (Address already in use):
![NodeEADDRINUSE](https://i.imgur.com/gjOM9Vp.png)

  Make sure that there is no application running that is using that port. If you don't know what process is using the port, run the following **(LINUX ONLY)** `netstat -peanut | grep 'PORT_HERE'` then run `kill 'PROCESS_ID'` (The process ID will be in a format like `12345/process`)

  ![KillProcess](https://i.imgur.com/zlgFpew.png)

- `ENOENT` (No such file or directory):
![NoNodeUploadTMP](https://i.imgur.com/lxe00fe.png)

  You should not find this as NodeUpload should automatically create a new directory if none is found. However, if you do find this issue, make a new directory named `nodeupload_tmp` in your operating system's tmp directory.

- `ENOENT` after installing dependencies: You may see an error that looks like this after installing the dependencies:
![SQLiteENOENT](https://i.imgur.com/bhJ7BbG.png)

  To fix this, delete the `node_modules` directory and run `npm install` again.

- `The program 'node' is currently not installed.`
![NodeNotInstall](https://i.imgur.com/xUHT8FJ.png)

  Follow the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

- `The program 'npm' is currently not installed.`

  Same as above.

- `Error: Cannot find module`
    ![NodeModule](https://i.imgur.com/YjtkIqQ.png)

    Run `npm install` in the terminal

  **For other errors, search for the error online or open an issue**
